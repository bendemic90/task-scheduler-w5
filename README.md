# task-scheduler-w5
A daily task scheduler

## Features
* Has input fields that are coloured dependent on time of day.
* Input text will be saved in localStorage, and will persist through refreshes.
* Colour coding based on moment().format("HH") - 24hr time.


## Reasoning
As a busy worker bee it is necessary for me to visualize the tasks ahead of me for the day.

## Challenges & Process
1. The layout was virtually given to us so this part was easy, there was plenty of existing CSS to work with.
2. There's probably more repitition than I would like, particularly for the IF statements determining colour but since it was working I was happy that it met the criteria without me going back and trying to remove lines.
3. It did take me a while to work out how to traverse and pull the value from localStorage but after that it was fairly straight forward.
